colorbrewer-colormaps-4-abaqus
===================

An easy way to use the beautiful color schemes at [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) in Abaqus to plot contour.

All ColorBrewer color schemes that include at least 8 colors are included. Each color scheme provides more than 8 discrete color palette.


Sequential Color Schemes
-------------------------

Sequential color schemes are good for emphasizing one extreme of ordered data: data collected at different time points, maps of population densities, etc. These color schemes are in the <code>sequential</code> directory. Specifically, there are 6 single hue schemes (Greys, Purples, Blues, Greens, Oranges, Reds) and 12 multihue schemes (BuGn, BuPu, GnBu, OrRd, PuBu, BuGn, PuRd, RdPu, YlGn, YlGnBu, YlOrBr, YlOrRd). Note that color #1 is very difficult to see on a white background.

Diverging Color Schemes
-------------------------

Diverging color schemes are good for emphasizing both extremes of ordered data: attributes of those with positive/neutral/negative opinions on an issue, maps of temperature deviation from a mean, etc. These color schemes are in the <code>diverging</code> directory. Specifically, there are 6 schemes centered about white (BrBG, PiYG, PuGn, PuOr, RdGy, RdBu) and 3 centered about yellow (RdYlGn, RdYlBu, Spectral), and the reversed schemes are also included. Note that Spectral is the most rainbow-like of the ColorBrewer schemes, although the central yellows are deemphasized compared to other rainbow or jet color schemes.

Usage
-----

Choose your desired color scheme by perusing [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/).
To use any color scheme, just run the python script in Abaqus/CAE. Then in `contour plot option` the new imported scheme could be found.
